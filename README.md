Wireguard is a prominent cryptographic protocol used for establishing encrypted Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). A key building block is the Noise protocol, which is used for the handshake. Key features of the Noise protocol are its modular design, emphasis on Diffie-Hellman key agreement, and formal verification.

The code works on compromising the communications between a client and server in order to recover some secret information. It appears that the client and server are using a custom protocol known as wireguard-lite.
